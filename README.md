# PrimalGameEngine
A game engine that is following the Game Engine Series on youtube

At the moment we have the following features:
-  ability to create a project based on 4 game types: Empty, First Person, Third Person, Top Down
-  Give a name of the project with a path (there is a default path)
-  Tells you if the project exists so that it does not allow you to make a project
-  If no projects exist cannot open a project
-  Opening a project where you are brought into an editor mode
-  Editor mode very very rudimentary, can add scenes and game entities (all empty for now)
-  Has an undo/redo system and a basic history and logging system
